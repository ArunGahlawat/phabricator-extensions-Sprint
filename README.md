Sprints and burndowns in Phabricator


WARNING: This is very rough draft and not functional at this point. You have been warned. 

To install, add this as a library to phabricator. Create a project with a name that includes "Sprint" and edit it to add a start date and end date. Then add some tasks to that project, and edit them to set some story points. After that, go to /burn/burndown/<Project ID> and view the burndown. (Which currently doesn't work at all)
